Health Insurance Cost prediction Using Watson Auto AI
This application leverages machine learning models to predict your insurance charges, and helps the customer understand how smoking or decreasing your BMI affects insurance premiums.

As we see the value of gross insurance premiums worldwide continue to skyrocket past 5 trillion dollars, we know that most of these costs are preventable. For example, just by eliminating smoking, and lowering your BMI by a few points could mean shaving thousands of dollars off of your premium charges. In this application, we study the effects of age, smoking, BMI, gender, and region to determine how much of a difference these factors can make on your insurance premium. By using our application, customers see the radical difference their lifestyle choices make on their insurance charges. By leveraging AI and machine learning, we help customers understand just how much smoking increases their premium, by predicting how much they will have to pay within seconds.

Description
Using IBM AutoAI, you automate all the tasks involved in building predictive models for different requirements. You see how AutoAI generates great models quickly which save time and effort and aid in faster decision-making process. You create a model that from a data set that includes the age, sex, BMI, number-of-children, smoking preferences, region and charges to predict the health insurance premium cost that an individual pays.

When you have completed this code pattern, you understand how to:

Setup, quickly, the services on IBM Cloud for building the model.
Ingest the data and initiate the AutoAI process.
Build different models using AutoAI and evaluate the performance.
Choose the best model and complete the deployment.
Generate predictions using the deployed model by making REST calls.
Compare the process of using AutoAI and building the model manually.
Visualize the deployed model using a front-end application.
